HW_ComputerArchitecture
This repository contains my implementation of key computer architecture simulations as part of my coursework. The project demonstrates my understanding of processor components, cache behavior, and data flow analysis.
Implemented Modules:
bp.cpp — Branch Prediction simulation.
cacheSim.cpp — Cache simulation and performance analysis.
core_api.cpp — Core API for managing processor instructions and operations.
dflow_calc.cpp — Data Flow calculations and dependency analysis.
Technologies & Skills:
C++ programming for system-level simulations.
Understanding of CPU architecture, pipelines, and memory hierarchy.
Analytical thinking and algorithm implementation.
Objective:
This project showcases practical skills in computer architecture and system simulation, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with hands-on programming.
